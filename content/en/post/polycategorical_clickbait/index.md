A quick compilation of facts about polycategories together with links to the appropriate litterature. Some are original work.

1. **Polycategories** have been introduced by Szabo in 1975 in [_Polycategories_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00927877508822067).
2. **Polycategories** are "categories with many-to-many morphisms", i.e. **polymaps** have many inputs and many outputs.
3. **Polycategories** correspond to **Gentzen classical sequent calculus**.
4. **Polycategories** compose on one object.
5. Composition of **Polycategories** is the cut rule.
6. **Representable polycategories**, a.k.a. two-tensor polycategories, are **linearly distributive categories**, see [_Weakly distributive categories_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404995001603).
7. In a **polycategory**, $\otimes$, â…‹ and duality are characterised by **universal properties**.
8. Representable polycategories with duals are called **$\ast$-representable**.
9. **Polycategories bifibred** over $\ast$-representable one are **$\ast$-representable**, see [_this paper_]({{< ref "publication/polybifibrations/index.md" >}}).
10. The **terminal polycategory** have one object $\ast$ and one polymap $\underline{(m,n)}$ for each arities.
11. A **Polycategory** is **$\ast$-representable** iff it is **bifibred** over the **terminal** one.
12. **Universal polymaps** are the **cartesian polymaps**, w.r.t. the functor into the terminal **Polycategory**.
13. **Frobenius algebras** are the generalised elements of **polycategories**.
14. There is a **Grothendieck correspondence** for polycategories.
