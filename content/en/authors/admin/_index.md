I am currently on a leave of absence from the University of Birmingham to do a research internship at [Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com).
I am investigating the formal verification of quantum programs written using DeltaFlow, their quantum OS.

I am also a 2nd-year PhD student in the [Theoretical Computer Science group](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/) at the University of Birmingham. My supervisor is [Noam Zeilberger](https://noamz.org/).
My research interests include linear logic, applied category theory, quantum computing, formal methods and type theory.

Before being in the west Midlands, I did a Master in [Mathematical Logic and Foundation of Computer Science](http://master.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/en/annee/m2-lmfi/) at the Paris Diderot University.
At this occasion, I did a five-month internship under the supervision of [Beno√Æt Valiron](https://www.monoidal.net/) on the syntax and semantics of a linear probabilistic $\lambda\mu$-calculus.

During the first year of my PhD, I have been developing a theory of [bifibrations of polycategories](publication/polybifibrations).
Amongst other things, I have used this theory to provide a way of lifting categorical models of multiplicative linear logic along a functor.
Now, in addition to building more of the theory, I would like to explore how to use it to model logical properties of systems.
The idea would be to study some interplay between compact closed categories (the systems) and $\ast$-autonomous categories (the logic).
