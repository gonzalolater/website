A quick compilation of facts about polycategories together with links to the appropriate litterature. Some are original work.

1. **Polycategories** have been introduced by Szabo in 1975 in [_Polycategories_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00927877508822067).
2. **Polycategories** are "categories with many-to-many morphisms", i.e. **polymaps** have many inputs and many outputs.
3. **Polycategories** correspond to **classical Gentzen sequent calculus**.
4. **Polycategories** compose on one object.
5. Composition of **Polycategories** is the cut rule.
6. **Representable Polycategories**, a.k.a. two-tensor polycategories, are **linearly distributive categories**, see [_Weakly distributive categories_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404995001603).
7. In a **Polycategory**, $\otimes$ and â…‹ are characterised by **universal properties**.
8. **Logic is Universal!**
9. **Polycategories bifibred** over representable one are **representable**, see [_my talk_]({{< ref "talk/SYCO5/index.md" >}}).
10. The **terminal Polycategory** have one object $\ast$ and one polymap $\underline{(m,n)}$ for each arities.
11. A **Polycategory** is **representable** iff it is **bifibred** over the **terminal** one.
12. **Universal polymaps** are the **opcartesian polymaps**, w.r.t. the functor into the terminal **Polycategory**.
13. **Universality is Fibrational!**
14. **Frobenius algebras** are the generalised elements of **Polycategories**.
