I am a PhD student in the [Theoretical Computer Science group](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/) at the University of Birmingham. My supervisor is [Noam Zeilberger](http://noamz.org/).\\
My research interests include models of linear logic, categorical semantics of non-classical programming languages - e.g. probabilistic or quantum programming languages - and monoidal categories.

Before that I did a Master in Mathematical Logic and Foudation of Computer Science at the Paris Diderot University. During this period I did a five-month internship under the supervision of [Beno√Æt Valiron](http://www.monoidal.net/) on the syntax and semantics of a linear probabilistic $\lambda\mu$-calculus.

Lately I have been investigated refinements of logical systems.\\
In categorical terms I have been looking at functors $p \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ such that the base category $\mathcal{B}$ is symmetric monoidal closed (SMC) or $\ast$-autonomous.\\
A natural question is: can the logical structure of $\mathcal{B}$ be lifted to the category $\mathcal{E}$?

A nice framework to analyse this is by moving to a multicategorical or polycategorical setting.\\
There the existence of some logical structure on $\mathcal{E}$ inherited by $\mathcal{B}$ reduced to (bi)fibrational properties of the multifunctor or polyfunctor associated to $p$.

My motivating example is the forgetful functor between the category of finite dimensional Banach spaces and contractive maps and the category of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps.\\
The former is $\ast$-autonomous with finite products and finite coproducts while the latter is compact closed with finite biproducts.\\
So in some sense considering norms on finite dimensional vector spaces gives a way to distinguish between conjunction and disjunction.
