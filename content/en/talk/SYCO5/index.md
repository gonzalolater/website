title: "Classical linear logic via bifibrations of polycategories"
event: Fifth Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO 5)
event_url: "events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/strings3-syco5/"
location: University of Birmingham, UK
summary: "Linearly distributives categories correspond to polycategories bifibred over the terminal polycategory."
abstract: "We give three ways of modelling classical multiplicative linear logic: as some structures on a category, so-called linearly distributive categories; by some universal properties in a polycategory, known as two-tensor polycategories; as fibrational properties on a polycategory, namely polycategories bifibred over the terminal one. The last characterisation is used to justify that bifibrations offer a way to lift logical properties from a base polycategory to one lying over it. This is illustrated on our running example: the category of finite dimensional Banach spaces and contractive linear maps inherits its (non-compact closed) star-autonomous structure from the (compact closed) category of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps."
