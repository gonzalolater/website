I am a PhD student in the [Theoretical Computer Science group](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/) at the University of Birmingham. My supervisors are [Noam Zeilberger](https://noamz.org/) and [Paul Levy](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/).
My research interests mainly involve category theory, logic and their applications.

I graduated from the Master in Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Computer Science at the Paris Diderot University. During this period I did a five-month internship under the supervision of [Beno√Æt Valiron](http://www.monoidal.net/) on the syntax and semantics of a linear probabilistic $\lambda\mu$-calculus.
Then I was using formal methods as a software engineer and safety engineer at [Clearsy](https://www.clearsy.com/en/) for almost two years.
More recently I did a research internship at [Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com/) about the specification and verification of dataflow programs.

During my PhD I have been investigating bifibred polycategories to provide models of refinements of classical multiplicative linear logic. This has lead to a [publication]({{< relref "publication/polybifibrations" >}}).

Lately I have been looking at developing a similar approach to (full) intuitionistic linear logic using some fibred generalised multicategories. This is inspired by linear non-linear logic and by recent work by Martin Hyland and Christine Tasson on its multicategorical models.
